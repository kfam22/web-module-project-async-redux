# The Love Poem Generator

In this project I built a React/Redux app that fetches data inside of an async action creator from a poetry API.

-Fetches poems referencing the words love and hate from poem API found at https://poetrydb.org/
-Returns nicely formatted poems with poet name and title in the form of a love or hate letter.  
-Click love me button for love poems and love me not button for hate poems.
